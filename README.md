# Anti-Anti-Adblock
A server side anti-anti-adblock written for JSoup. It allows you to execute any piece of JavaScript in the user's browser in the case an ad-blocker is detected.

It is basically just a copy of: http://www.bytemycode.com/snippets/snippet/865/ rewritten in Java.

It depends on the Apache Commons Lang and JSoup (The JSoup dependency can easily be averted by changing about three lines of code).

Everything sent to the client is heavilly randomized and shuffled.

(Please note: I don't use this personally as I use an adblocker myself!)

Please don't use this too heavily, and dont get to greedy :)
